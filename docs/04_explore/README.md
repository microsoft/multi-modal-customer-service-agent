#### Overview
In this exercise, you'll extend the existing multi-agent customer service system by adding a new car rental agent. This will demonstrate the scalability and extensibility of the architecture, showing how new business domains can be added without disrupting existing functionality.

#### What You'll Build
- A complete car rental agent with booking and policy search capabilities
- Integration with the existing intent detection system
- Semantic search functionality for rental policies
- Proper error handling and validation

#### Understanding Multi-Agent Architecture

Before we begin building, let's understand how the multi-agent system works and where our new car rental agent fits:

##### 🏗️ Architecture Overview
The system uses a **Router-Agent pattern** with specialized domain agents:

![Logical Architecture](../../media/logical_architecture.png)

**Multi-Agent System Components:**

| Component | Role | Responsibility |
|:----------|:-----|:---------------|
| 🧠 **Router Agent** | Central Dispatcher | Analyzes user intent and routes to the appropriate specialized agent |
| ✈️ **Flight Agent** | Domain Expert | Handles all flight bookings, status checks, and airline policies |
| 🏨 **Hotel Agent** | Domain Expert | Manages hotel reservations and accommodation information |
| 🚗 **Car Rental Agent** | Domain Expert<br>(NEW!) | Provides car rental services, availability, and policy information |

**Pattern Flow:**
1. User query → Router Agent analyzes intent
2. Router selects appropriate domain agent based on intent classification
3. Domain agent processes query using specialized tools and knowledge
4. Response is returned to the user via the original interaction channel

##### 🔄 Agent Interaction Flow

| Step | Process | Description |
|:----:|:-------:|:------------|
| 1️⃣ | **User Input** | Customer query is received by the system |
| 2️⃣ | **Intent Analysis** | Router agent analyzes the intent of the query |
| 3️⃣ | **Agent Selection** | Query is routed to the appropriate domain agent (Flight, Hotel, or Car Rental) |
| 4️⃣ | **Tool Execution** | Selected agent uses specialized tools to fulfill the request |
| 5️⃣ | **Response Generation** | Agent formulates a natural language response |
| 6️⃣ | **User Delivery** | Response is delivered back to the customer |

##### 💡 Why This Pattern?

| Key Benefit | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| 🧩 **Separation of Concerns** | Each specialized agent handles one business domain, allowing focused development and expertise |
| 📈 **Scalability** | New domains can be added without disrupting existing functionality |
| 🔧 **Maintainability** | Domain-specific logic is isolated, making it easier to update and debug |
| 🔄 **Flexibility** | Individual agents can be modified or replaced independently |
| 🚀 **Performance** | Router efficiently directs queries to specialized agents with domain knowledge |

##### 🧩 Components We'll Build

| Component | File/Resource | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------------|:--------|
| 🛠️ **Agent Tools** | `car_rental_plugins.py` | Functions the agent can call to perform car rental operations |
| 🤖 **Agent Profile** | `car_rental_agent_profile.yaml` | Defines the agent's persona, behavior, and system prompts |
| 🔌 **System Integration** | Updates to existing code | Connects the new agent to the router and intent detection system |
| 🧠 **Knowledge Base** | Embedding-based search | Provides semantic search for car rental policies using Azure OpenAI embeddings |

#### Step 1: Create the Car Rental Tools Plugin

Now let's build the tools that give our car rental agent its capabilities.

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Defines the functions (tools) our agent can use
- Implements mock car rental operations
- Sets up the foundation for semantic search

Create a new file `car_rental_plugins.py` in `voice_agent\app\backend\agents\tools\` and add the following code:

**File Path:** `c:\Code\multi-modal-customer-service-agent\voice_agent\app\backend\agents\tools\car_rental_plugins.py`

##### 🔧 Understanding Semantic Kernel Functions

Before we write the code, let's understand what we're building:

- **`@kernel_function`**: This decorator tells Semantic Kernel that this function can be called by the LLM
- **`description`**: Helps the LLM understand when to use this function
- **`name`**: The function name the LLM will reference
- **Async functions**: All agent tools are asynchronous for better performance

<details>
<summary>🔽 Click to expand car_rental_plugins.py - Part 1: Basic Setup</summary>

```python
from typing import List
from semantic_kernel import Kernel
from semantic_kernel.functions import kernel_function

class Car_Rental_Tools:
    """Tools for car rental agent to perform various rental operations"""
```

**📝 What this does:**
- Imports required Semantic Kernel components
- Creates the main tools class that will contain all car rental functions
- The docstring helps document the purpose of this class

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔽 Click to expand car_rental_plugins.py - Part 2: Car Search Function</summary>

```python
    @kernel_function(
        description="Search for available rental cars based on location and dates",
        name="search_cars"
    )
    async def search_cars(self, location: str, pickup_date: str, return_date: str) -> str:
        """
        Search for available rental cars at a specific location and date range.
        
        Args:
            location: The pickup location (e.g., "New York", "LAX Airport")
            pickup_date: The rental start date (e.g., "2025-07-15")
            return_date: The rental end date (e.g., "2025-07-20")
            
        Returns:
            Formatted string with available car options
        """
        # Mock implementation - in production, this would call a real car rental API
        return f"Found available cars in {location} from {pickup_date} to {return_date}: \n" \
                "1. Economy - Toyota Corolla ($45/day)\n" \
                "2. SUV - Honda CR-V ($65/day)\n" \
                "3. Luxury - BMW 5 Series ($95/day)"
```

**📝 What this does:**
- Provides car search functionality based on location and dates
- Returns formatted results that the LLM can present to users
- Uses mock data for demonstration (you'd replace with real API calls)

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔽 Click to expand car_rental_plugins.py - Part 3: Car Details Function</summary>

```python
    @kernel_function(
        description="Get detailed information about a specific rental car",
        name="get_car_details"
    )
    async def get_car_details(self, car_id: str) -> str:
        """
        Get detailed specifications and features for a specific car.
        
        Args:
            car_id: The ID of the car to get details for (e.g., "1", "2", "3")
            
        Returns:
            Detailed car specifications and features
        """
        # Mock car database - in production, this would query a real database
        car_details = {
            "1": "Toyota Corolla: 4 doors, 5 seats, automatic transmission, GPS, bluetooth",
            "2": "Honda CR-V: 5 doors, 5 seats, automatic transmission, GPS, bluetooth, roof rack",
            "3": "BMW 5 Series: 4 doors, 5 seats, automatic transmission, GPS, bluetooth, leather seats"
        }
        return car_details.get(car_id, "Car not found - please check the car ID")
```
</details>

**📝 What this does:**
- Provides detailed information about specific vehicles
- Uses a simple lookup system for mock data
- Includes error handling for invalid car IDs

**✅ Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] File created in correct directory: `voice_agent\app\backend\agents\tools\`
- [ ] All imports are correct and no syntax errors
- [ ] Functions are properly decorated with `@kernel_function`
- [ ] Function descriptions clearly explain their purpose
- [ ] Mock data returns realistic car rental information

**🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues:**
- **Import Error**: Ensure Semantic Kernel is installed: `pip install semantic-kernel`
- **Directory Not Found**: Create the directory structure if it doesn't exist
- **Syntax Errors**: Check Python indentation and parentheses matching
- **Function Not Found**: Verify the `@kernel_function` decorator is applied correctly

#### Step 2: Create the Car Rental Agent Profile

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Defines the agent's personality and behavior
- Sets up the conversational persona for car rental interactions
- Configures how the agent should respond to different situations

##### 🤖 Understanding Agent Profiles

Agent profiles in this system define:
- **Persona**: How the agent should behave and communicate
- **Context Variables**: Dynamic information like customer name and ID
- **Responsibilities**: What the agent should and shouldn't do
- **Tone**: Professional, helpful, courteous communication style

#### Create the Car Rental Agent Profile

Create the agent configuration file that defines the car rental agent's persona and behavior.

**File Path:** `c:\Code\multi-modal-customer-service-agent\voice_agent\app\backend\agents\agent_profiles\car_rental_agent_profile.yaml`
<details>
<summary>🔽 Click to expand car_rental_agent_profile.yaml code</summary>

```yaml  
    name: car_rental_agent
    default_agent: false
    persona: |
        You are a helpful car rental agent assisting {customer_name} (ID: {customer_id}).
        Your role is to help customers find and book rental cars that match their needs.
        
        Key responsibilities:
        - Search for available rental cars based on location and dates
        - Provide detailed information about specific vehicles
        - Explain rental policies and requirements
        - Help with booking process
        
        Always be professional and courteous while providing accurate information.
```
</details>

**✅ Validation:** Confirm the YAML file is properly formatted and saved in the agent_profiles directory.

#### Step 3: Integrate the Agent into the System

Update the RTMiddleTier class to recognize and load the new car rental agent.

**File to Modify:** `c:\Code\multi-modal-customer-service-agent\voice_agent\app\backend\rtmt.py`

Add the import statement at the top of the file:

<details>
<summary>🔽 Click to expand import and _load_agents method changes</summary>

**Add import at the top of the file:**
```python
from agents.tools.car_rental_plugins import Car_Rental_Tools
```

**Update the `_load_agents` method:**
```python
# ...existing code...
def _load_agents(self):
    base_path = "agents/agent_profiles"
    agent_profiles = [f for f in os.listdir(base_path) if f.endswith("_profile.yaml")]
    for profile in agent_profiles:
        profile_path = os.path.join(base_path, profile)
        with open(profile_path, "r") as file:
            try:
                data = yaml.safe_load(file)
                self.agents.append(data)
                agent_name = data.get("name")
                self.kernels[agent_name] = Kernel()
                if agent_name == "hotel_agent":
                    self.kernels[agent_name].add_plugin(
                            plugin=Hotel_Tools(),
                            plugin_name="hotel_tools",
                            description="tools for hotel agent"
                        )
                    elif agent_name == "flight_agent":
                        self.kernels[agent_name].add_plugin(
                            plugin=Flight_Tools(),
                            plugin_name="flight_tools",
                            description="tools for flight agent"
                        )
                    elif agent_name == "car_rental_agent":  # Add this section
                        self.kernels[agent_name].add_plugin(
                            plugin=Car_Rental_Tools(),
                            plugin_name="car_rental_tools",
                            description="tools for car rental agent"
                        )
    # ...existing code...
```
</details>

#### Step 4: Update Intent Detection

Configure the system to recognize car rental-related queries and route them to the new agent.

**File to Modify:** `c:\Code\multi-modal-customer-service-agent\voice_agent\app\backend\utility.py`

Update the `detect_intent` method to include the car rental agent in the system message:    
<details>
    <summary>🔽 Click to expand intent detection update</summary>

**Update message parameter to include:**

```python
    - **car_rental_agent**: Deal with car rentals, vehicle reservations, changes, and general car rental policy questions.
```
</details>

> **📝 Note:** The intent detection model has already been updated to recognize car rental-related queries. See the `intent_detection_model` directory for training data and model details.

#### Step 5: Add Semantic Search for Rental Policies

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Implements intelligent policy search using AI embeddings
- Enables the agent to answer complex policy questions
- Demonstrates advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) patterns

##### 🧠 Understanding Embeddings and Semantic Search

Before we implement the search functionality, let's understand the concepts:

**What are Embeddings?**
- Embeddings are vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning
- Similar concepts have similar embeddings (even with different words)
- Example: "car insurance" and "vehicle coverage" would have similar embeddings

**How Semantic Search Works:**
```
1. User Question: "What's covered in basic insurance?"
   ↓
2. Convert question to embedding vector
   ↓
3. Compare with all policy embeddings using cosine similarity
   ↓
4. Return most relevant policy documents
   ↓
5. LLM uses retrieved policies to answer the question
```

**Why This is Powerful:**
- Understands intent, not just keywords
- Works across different phrasings of the same question
- Scales to large knowledge bases

Implement knowledge base search capabilities using Azure OpenAI embeddings for car rental policies.

##### Step 5a: Create the Rental Policy Knowledge Base

Create a structured JSON file containing car rental policy information that will be searchable.

**🗂️ Knowledge Base Structure:**
- Each policy has an ID, human-readable text, and space for embeddings
- The `policy_text_embedding` field will store the vector representation
- Initially set to `null` - we'll generate these in a later step

**File Path:** `c:\Code\multi-modal-customer-service-agent\voice_agent\app\backend\data\car_rental_policy.json`
<details>
    <summary>🔽 Click to expand car_rental_policy.json content</summary>

```json
    [
        {
            "id": "insurance_basic",
            "policy_text": "Basic insurance coverage is mandatory and includes: Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), Third Party Liability (TPL), and Personal Accident Insurance (PAI). Daily rate varies by vehicle class.",
            "policy_text_embedding": null
        },
        {
            "id": "insurance_premium",
            "policy_text": "Premium insurance package includes basic coverage plus: Zero deductible, Tire and glass coverage, Personal effects coverage, and Roadside assistance. Available for an additional $15/day.",
            "policy_text_embedding": null
        },
        {
            "id": "rental_requirements",
            "policy_text": "Renters must be at least 21 years old, possess a valid driver's license, and present a major credit card. Additional fees apply for drivers under 25.",
            "policy_text_embedding": null
        }
    ]
```
</details>

**✅ Validation:** Verify the JSON file is valid and saved in the correct data directory.

##### Step 5b: Update the Plugin with Search Capabilities

Enhance the car rental plugin with Azure OpenAI embedding search functionality.

**File to Modify:** `c:\Code\multi-modal-customer-service-agent\voice_agent\app\backend\agents\tools\car_rental_plugins.py`

Add the required imports and search functionality:
<details>
    <summary>🔽 Click to expand imports & search content</summary>

```python
    # Azure OpenAI client setup  
    embedding_client = AzureOpenAI(  
        api_key=AZURE_OPENAI_EMB_API_KEY,  
        azure_endpoint=AZURE_OPENAI_EMB_ENDPOINT,  
        api_version="2023-12-01-preview"  
    )  

    def get_embedding(text: str, model: str = AZURE_OPENAI_EMB_DEPLOYMENT) -> list[float]:  
        """Generate text embeddings using Azure OpenAI."""  
        text = text.replace("\n", " ")  
        return embedding_client.embeddings.create(input=[text], model=model).data[0].embedding  

    class SearchClient:  
        """Client for performing semantic search on a knowledge base."""  
        def __init__(self, emb_map_file_path: str):  
            with open(emb_map_file_path) as file:  
                self.chunks_emb = json.load(file)  
        
        def find_article(self, question: str, topk: int = 3) -> str:  
            """Find relevant articles based on cosine similarity."""  
            input_vector = get_embedding(question)  
            cosine_list = [  
                (item['id'], item['policy_text'], 1 - spatial.distance.cosine(input_vector, item['policy_text_embedding']))  
                for item in self.chunks_emb  
            ]  
            cosine_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)  
            cosine_list = cosine_list[:topk]  
        
            return "\n".join(f"{chunk_id}\n{content}" for chunk_id, content, _ in cosine_list)      # Initialize the search client
    search_client = SearchClient("./data/car_rental_policy.json")
 ```
 </details>

##### Step 5c: Add Policy Search Function to Plugin

Update the Car_Rental_Tools class to include the policy search capability.

Add the required imports and search function to the plugin:

<details>
    <summary>🔽 Click to expand additional imports and search function</summary>

**Add these imports at the top of the file:**
```python
    from openai import AzureOpenAI
    import json
    from scipy import spatial
```

**Add this function to the Car_Rental_Tools class:**
```python
    @kernel_function(
        name="search_rental_policies",
        description="Search car rental and insurance policies for relevant information."
    )
    async def search_rental_policies(self, 
        search_query: Annotated[str, "The search query about rental or insurance policies."]
    ) -> str:
        return search_client.find_article(search_query)
```
</details>

##### Step 5d: Create Embedding Generation Script

**🎯 What This Script Does:**
- Reads the policy JSON file we created
- Calls Azure OpenAI to generate embeddings for each policy
- Saves the embeddings back to the JSON file
- Prepares the data for semantic search

**🔧 How Embedding Generation Works:**
1. **Load Policy Text** → Read human-readable policy descriptions
2. **Call Azure OpenAI** → Convert text to 1536-dimensional vectors
3. **Store Embeddings** → Save vectors alongside original text
4. **Enable Search** → Embeddings allow semantic similarity comparisons

Create a script to generate embeddings for the rental policy data.

**File Path:** `c:\Code\multi-modal-customer-service-agent\voice_agent\app\backend\scripts\generate_car_rental_policy_embeddings.py`

<details>
<summary>🔽 Click to expand embedding generation script</summary>

```python
import json
from openai import AzureOpenAI
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

def generate_embeddings(input_file: str):
    """
    Generate embeddings for policy documents using Azure OpenAI.
    
    This function:
    1. Reads policy data from JSON file
    2. Generates embeddings for each policy text
    3. Saves embeddings back to the same file
    
    Args:
        input_file: Path to the JSON file containing policy data
    """
    # Initialize Azure OpenAI client for embeddings
    client = AzureOpenAI(
        api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_EMB_API_KEY"),
        azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_EMB_ENDPOINT"),
        api_version="2023-12-01-preview"
    )

    print(f"Loading policy data from {input_file}...")
    # Load the JSON file
    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)

    print(f"Generating embeddings for {len(data)} policy documents...")
    # Generate embeddings for each policy text
    for item in data:
        print(f"Processing policy: {item['id']}")
        response = client.embeddings.create(
            input=[item['policy_text']],
            model=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_EMB_DEPLOYMENT")
        )
        # Store the embedding vector (list of 1536 floating point numbers)
        item['policy_text_embedding'] = response.data[0].embedding

    print(f"Saving embeddings back to {input_file}...")
    # Save the updated JSON with embeddings
    output_file = input_file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        json.dump(data, file, indent=2)
    
    print("✅ Embedding generation complete!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_embeddings("./data/car_rental_policy.json")
```
</details>

**📝 Important Notes:**
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure your `.env` file has the embedding API credentials
- **Processing Time**: Embedding generation may take a few seconds per document
- **API Costs**: Each embedding call uses Azure OpenAI tokens
- **File Size**: The JSON file will grow significantly after adding embeddings

### Exercise 1: Upgrade LLM and Evaluate with Azure AI Evaluation SDK

#### Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, you will learn how to:
- Implement systematic LLM evaluation using industry-standard metrics
- Use the Azure AI Evaluation SDK to assess AI agent performance
- Compare different models quantitatively to make data-driven decisions
- Establish performance baselines for AI systems
- Track performance improvements over time
- Apply best practices for model upgrades in production

#### Prerequisites
- Completed [Environment Setup](../02_setup/README.md)
- Basic understanding of Python and VS Code
- Access to Azure OpenAI resources
- Familiarity with AI evaluation concepts
- Understanding of the flight agent implementation

#### Estimated Time
90 minutes

#### Why LLM Evaluation Matters

Before we dive into the technical implementation, let's understand why rigorous model evaluation is critical in production AI systems:

##### 🔍 The Importance of Systematic Evaluation
LLM-powered agents can be unpredictable, and changes that seem minor can have significant impacts on:

- **Functional Correctness**: Does the agent perform required tasks accurately?
- **Reliability**: Does the agent behave consistently across similar inputs?
- **Safety**: Does the agent avoid harmful or incorrect outputs?
- **Efficiency**: Does the agent complete tasks with minimal interactions?

##### 📊 Key Evaluation Metrics Explained

When evaluating AI agents, different metrics reveal different aspects of performance:

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters | Ideal Score |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Groundedness** | How factually accurate responses are based on provided context | Prevents hallucinations and misinformation | 1.0 (high) |
| **Coherence** | How logical and well-structured responses are | Ensures clear communication | 1.0 (high) |
| **Relevance** | How well responses address the user's query | Prevents off-topic responses | 1.0 (high) |
| **Intent Resolution** | Accuracy in identifying the user's intent | Ensures correct understanding of requests | 1.0 (high) |
| **Tool Call Accuracy** | Correct tool selection and parameter passing | Prevents errors in automated actions | 1.0 (high) |
| **Task Adherence** | Staying focused on the required task | Prevents scope creep and distractions | 1.0 (high) |

##### 📈 Performance Tracking Approach

To effectively monitor LLM performance over time:

1. **Establish baseline** with current model
2. **Track deltas** when making changes (model, prompts, etc.)
3. **Maintain a test suite** covering diverse scenarios
4. **Log results** historically to identify trends or regressions

#### Steps Overview

1. Review current LLM configuration 
2. Install required evaluation packages
3. Create & understand the evaluation framework
4. Run baseline evaluation
5. Analyze baseline results
6. Upgrade the LLM
7. Run comparative evaluation
8. Analyze performance improvements
9. Document findings and recommendations

#### Step 1: Review Current LLM Configuration

First, let's examine the current model configuration to understand our starting point.

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Identifies the currently deployed model
- Establishes the configuration we'll be comparing against
- Ensures we're testing the correct deployment

Review the current LLM environment variable in the `.env` file in the backend directory:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-mini
```

This variable tells us which Azure OpenAI model deployment is currently being used by the flight agent. In this case, it's using `gpt-4o-mini`, which is a smaller, faster version of GPT-4o.

**📝 Key Model Characteristics:**
- **GPT-4o-mini**: Optimized for speed and cost with reasonable quality
- **Strengths**: Fast responses, lower cost, good for common queries
- **Limitations**: May struggle with complex reasoning or edge cases

**✅ Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Confirmed current model deployment name
- [ ] Noted model version for reference
- [ ] Checked if model supports all required capabilities (tool use, etc.)

#### Step 2: Install Required Evaluation Packages

The Azure AI Evaluation SDK provides comprehensive tools for assessing model performance.

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Sets up the required dependencies for evaluation
- Ensures consistent evaluation across different runs
- Prepares the environment for testing multiple models

Install the Azure AI Evaluation SDK:

```bash
pip install azure-ai-evaluation python-dotenv
```

Or add these lines to `voice_agent/app/backend/requirements.txt`:

```
azure-ai-evaluation
python-dotenv
```

Then run:

```bash
pip install -r voice_agent/app/backend/requirements.txt
```

**📋 What We're Installing:**
- **azure-ai-evaluation**: Microsoft's SDK for evaluating LLM performance
- **python-dotenv**: For loading environment variables from .env files

**✅ Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Packages installed successfully
- [ ] No version conflicts or dependency issues
- [ ] Environment ready for evaluation tasks

#### Step 3: Create the Evaluation Framework

Now we'll create a comprehensive evaluation script that tests the flight agent's performance across multiple dimensions and scenarios.

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Defines relevant test cases that exercise the agent's capabilities
- Configures multiple evaluation metrics
- Creates a reusable framework for ongoing evaluations

Create a new file at `voice_agent/app/backend/tests/test_flight_agent_evaluation.py`.

# Load environment variables
endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")
api_key = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")
model = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT", "gpt-4o-mini")

# Model config for evaluators
model_config = {
    "azure_deployment": model,  # The current model deployment
    "azure_endpoint": endpoint,
    "api_key": api_key
}

# Create a unique run ID for tracking this evaluation session
run_id = f"{model}-{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')}"
```

**📝 What This Does:**
- Imports required evaluation metrics from Azure AI Evaluation SDK
- Loads environment variables for Azure OpenAI access
- Creates a configuration for the evaluator models
- Sets up a unique run ID to track evaluation results over time

#### Step 4: Run Baseline Evaluation

Now that we've built our evaluation framework, let's establish a baseline with the current model.

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Measures current performance with the existing LLM
- Creates a reference point for comparison
- Identifies areas of strength and weakness

Execute the script to evaluate your flight agent:

```bash
cd voice_agent/app/backend
python -m tests.test_flight_agent_evaluation
```

The output will display scores for each evaluator across all test cases, along with aggregate metrics.

**📊 Expected Output Format:**

#### Step 5: Analyze Baseline Results

After running the evaluation, it's time to interpret the results systematically.

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Identifies specific performance patterns
- Pinpoints areas for improvement
- Sets expectations for model upgrades

##### 📊 Interpreting Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | What Good Looks Like | What Bad Looks Like | How to Improve |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Groundedness** | Facts match source context | Fabricated details | Better context handling in agent prompts |
| **Coherence** | Logical, well-structured responses | Confusing or contradictory answers | Enhance system prompts with structure guidance |
| **Relevance** | Direct answers to user queries | Off-topic or tangential responses | Improve intent detection and focus directives |
| **IntentResolution** | Correctly identifies user needs | Misunderstands user requests | Enhance intent categorization in prompts |
| **ToolCallAccuracy** | Correct tools with proper parameters | Wrong tools or invalid parameters | Better tool documentation in system prompts |
| **TaskAdherence** | Stays on task consistently | Gets distracted or veers off-topic | Add focus directives in system prompts |

##### Understanding Evaluation Results:

The evaluation results provide rich information beyond just a numeric score:

- **score value**: The numeric score (e.g., 4.0 for Groundedness)
- **_result**: Whether the response passes or fails according to a threshold (e.g., 'pass', 'fail')
- **_threshold**: The minimum value to be considered passing (e.g., 3)
- **_reason**: Detailed explanation of the score and reasoning
- **additional_details**: More specific information about the evaluation

When analyzing the baseline results, pay attention not just to the numeric scores but also to the qualitative feedback in the `_reason` fields, which can provide valuable insights into specific areas for improvement.

##### Finding Patterns in Test Results

Look for patterns across your test cases:

1. **Are certain metrics consistently low?** This suggests a systematic issue.
2. **Do specific scenarios perform poorly?** This may indicate domain knowledge gaps.
3. **Are there outlier cases?** These may reveal edge case handling issues.
4. **How do complex vs. simple queries compare?** This shows scaling with complexity.

**📝 Document Your Findings:**
Create a baseline findings document that captures:
- Current performance levels across all metrics
- Specific areas of strength and weakness
- Hypotheses about what might improve with a model upgrade
- Priority areas for improvement

#### Step 6: Upgrade the LLM

Now it's time to evaluate an upgraded model to see if it addresses the issues identified in the baseline.

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Changes the deployed model to a newer or more capable version
- Prepares for comparative evaluation
- Implements best practices for model transitions

**Option A: Update Local Environment for Testing**

Edit the `.env` file in the backend directory to use a different model:

```
# Change this:
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-mini

# To this:
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o
```

**Option B: Test Multiple Models in Script**

Alternatively, you can modify the evaluation script to test multiple models in a single run:

```python
# Add at the top of your script
models_to_test = ["gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4o"]

# Then modify the evaluation loop to iterate through models
for model in models_to_test:
    model_config = {
        "azure_deployment": model,
        "azure_endpoint": endpoint,
        "api_key": api_key
    }
    # Run evaluation with this model...
```

**📋 Model Upgrade Best Practices:**
1. **Start with testing**, not production deployment
2. **Document the upgrade** process and expected outcomes
3. **Configure fallback mechanisms** in case of issues
4. **Monitor closely** after upgrading

#### Step 7: Run Comparative Evaluation

Run the evaluation with the new model to see the performance differences.

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Collects performance data on the upgraded model
- Enables direct comparison with baseline
- Provides evidence for upgrade decisions

Execute the script again with the new model:

```bash
cd voice_agent/app/backend
python -m tests.test_flight_agent_evaluation
```

The results will be saved to a new file with the new model name in the ID.

#### Step 8: Analyze Performance Improvements

Compare the results between models to quantify improvements and identify any new issues.

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Quantifies the benefits of the model upgrade
- Identifies any regressions or unexpected behavior
- Provides data for cost-benefit analysis

##### 📊 Creating a Comparative Analysis

Create a comparison between the models using the saved result files:

```python
# Sample comparison script (add to your evaluation script if desired)
import json
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def compare_results(file1, file2):
    with open(file1, 'r') as f1, open(file2, 'r') as f2:
        results1 = json.load(f1)
        results2 = json.load(f2)
    
    model1 = results1["model"]
    model2 = results2["model"]
    
    metrics = list(results1["aggregate_metrics"].keys())
    model1_scores = [results1["aggregate_metrics"][m]["mean"] for m in metrics]
    model2_scores = [results2["aggregate_metrics"][m]["mean"] for m in metrics]
    
    # Print comparison
    print(f"\n=== Model Comparison: {model1} vs {model2} ===")
    for i, metric in enumerate(metrics):
        diff = model2_scores[i] - model1_scores[i]
        print(f"{metric}: {model1}={model1_scores[i]:.4f}, {model2}={model2_scores[i]:.4f}, " +
              f"Difference: {diff:.4f} ({diff/model1_scores[i]*100:.2f}%)")
    
    # Optional: Create visualization
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
    x = range(len(metrics))
    width = 0.35
    ax.bar([i - width/2 for i in x], model1_scores, width, label=model1)
    ax.bar([i + width/2 for i in x], model2_scores, width, label=model2)
    ax.set_ylabel('Score')
    ax.set_title('Model Comparison by Metric')
    ax.set_xticks(x)
    ax.set_xticklabels(metrics)
    ax.legend()
    plt.savefig(f"evaluation_results/comparison_{model1}_vs_{model2}.png")
    
    return {
        "model1": model1,
        "model2": model2,
        "metrics": {
            m: {
                "model1_score": results1["aggregate_metrics"][m]["mean"],
                "model2_score": results2["aggregate_metrics"][m]["mean"],
                "difference": results2["aggregate_metrics"][m]["mean"] - results1["aggregate_metrics"][m]["mean"],
                "percent_change": (results2["aggregate_metrics"][m]["mean"] - results1["aggregate_metrics"][m]["mean"]) / 
                                results1["aggregate_metrics"][m]["mean"] * 100
            } for m in metrics
        }
    }

# Usage:
# comparison = compare_results("evaluation_results/flight_agent_eval_gpt-4o-mini-20250618-142536.json", 
#                           "evaluation_results/flight_agent_eval_gpt-4o-20250618-143045.json")
```

**📊 Key Metrics to Compare:**

1. **Overall metrics improvement**: How much better is the new model across all metrics?
2. **Performance on weak areas**: Did the new model address specific weaknesses?
3. **Consistency**: Is performance more consistent across different test cases?
4. **Error rates**: Are there fewer errors or failures?

#### Step 9: Document Findings and Next Steps

Prepare a comprehensive analysis of your findings to guide the upgrade decision.

**🎯 What This Step Accomplishes:**
- Creates clear documentation of the evaluation process
- Provides evidence-based recommendations
- Establishes a framework for future evaluations

**⚙️ Best Practices for Production Upgrades**

1. **Implement gradual rollout**:
   - Start with a small percentage of traffic
   - Monitor closely for issues
   - Gradually increase traffic if performance is good

2. **Set up comprehensive monitoring**:
   - Track key metrics in real-time
   - Set alerts for performance degradation
   - Implement automated fallbacks if needed

3. **Maintain model versioning**:
   - Document all model changes
   - Keep previous model available as fallback
   - Track changes in performance over time

4. **Regular re-evaluation**:
   - Schedule periodic evaluations
   - Add new test cases as issues are discovered
   - Continuously improve evaluation framework
