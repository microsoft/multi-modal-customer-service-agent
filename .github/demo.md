# GitHub Copilot Demo: Voice Agent Project

## Demo Talk Track: One-Hour Comprehensive Journey

This talk track provides a guided demonstration of GitHub Copilot features using the voice_agent project as a context. It's designed for a one-hour session that progressively builds knowledge and demonstrates increasingly complex capabilities.

## Setup Instructions

Before the demo, ensure you have:

1. Visual Studio Code installed with the GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat extensions
2. The voice_agent project loaded in your workspace
3. Created a car_rental_plugins.py file (if it doesn't already exist)

## 0. Introduction (5 minutes)

### Key Points:

- GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps write code faster with fewer errors
- Copilot has two main interfaces:
  - **Inline Copilot**: Provides real-time suggestions as you type
  - **Copilot Chat**: A conversational interface for more complex interactions

### Demo:
- Show the Copilot icon in the status bar
- Show how to access Copilot Chat via the sidebar
- Briefly explain the voice_agent project we'll be using throughout the demo

## 1. Basic Code Completion (10 minutes)

### Feature: Inline Code Suggestions

#### Example 1: Completing Simple Functions
1. Open `voice_agent/app/backend/agents/tools/car_rental_plugins.py`
2. Start typing a search function: 
```python
def search_available_cars(location, start_date, end_date):
    """
    Search for available rental cars based on location and date range.
    
    Args:
        location (str): The pickup location
        start_date (str): The rental start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
        end_date (str): The rental end date (YYYY-MM-DD)
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of available car options
    """
    # Let Copilot complete this function
```

3. Show how Copilot suggests implementations based on function signature and docstring
4. Accept the suggestion and explain how it understood the required structure

#### Example 2: Function Based on Similar Patterns
1. Start writing another function that follows patterns seen elsewhere in the codebase:
```python
def get_car_details(car_id):
    """
    Get detailed information about a specific car.
    
    Args:
        car_id (str): The unique identifier for the car
        
    Returns:
        dict: Details about the car
    """
    # Let Copilot complete this function
```
2. Discuss how Copilot learns from existing code patterns

## 2. Using Chat Commands (10 minutes)

### Feature: GitHub Copilot Chat Interface

#### /explain Command
1. Select a complex code section in `voice_agent/app/backend/rtmt.py` (like the `_forward_messages` method)
2. Type `/explain` in the Copilot Chat panel
3. Show how Copilot provides a detailed explanation of the code

#### /fix Command
1. Introduce a subtle bug in a function (for example, in `detect_intent`)
2. Use `/fix` in the Copilot Chat to identify and fix the issue
3. Discuss how Copilot can help diagnose problems

#### /tests Command
1. Select a function like `search_available_cars` that you created earlier
2. Type `/tests` in Copilot Chat
3. Show how Copilot generates appropriate unit tests for the function

## 3. Advanced Code Generation (10 minutes)

### Feature: Generating Complex Components

#### Example 1: Creating a REST API Endpoint
1. Ask Copilot to create a new API endpoint for the car rental service:
   "Create a FastAPI endpoint for retrieving rental car availability"
2. Show how Copilot builds a complete endpoint with input validation, error handling, and documentation
3. Discuss how it integrates with the existing project structure

#### Example 2: Building Front-end Components
1. Ask Copilot to create a React component for displaying available cars:
   "Create a React component to display available rental cars with filtering options"
2. Highlight how Copilot generates not just the component structure but also styling and functionality

## 4. Code Refactoring and Improvement (10 minutes)

### Feature: Using # Commands

#### #refactor
1. Select a function that could use improvement
2. Type "#refactor" above the function
3. Demonstrate how Copilot suggests a cleaner, more efficient implementation

#### #improve
1. Find a section with repetitive code
2. Type "#improve" above it
3. Show how Copilot suggests better patterns like using list comprehensions or reducing duplicated code

#### #add_types
1. Select a function without type annotations
2. Type "#add_types" above it
3. Demonstrate how Copilot adds appropriate type hints

## 5. Documentation Generation (5 minutes)

### Feature: Creating Documentation

#### Example 1: Generating Function Documentation
1. Write a function signature without docstrings
2. Show how Copilot automatically suggests comprehensive docstrings

#### Example 2: Creating README Files
1. Ask Copilot: "Create documentation for the car rental agent"
2. Show how it generates well-structured markdown documentation

## 6. Special Commands: @ and / References (5 minutes)

### Feature: Contextual References

#### @ References
1. Type "@filename" in Copilot Chat to reference a specific file
2. Ask questions about that file, like "@car_rental_plugins.py how can I add caching to the search function?"

#### / File Commands
1. Use "/file create" to create a new file with Copilot
2. Demonstrate "/file edit" to make changes to existing files

## 7. Intent Detection Enhancement (10 minutes)

### Feature: Full Project Understanding

#### Task: Add Car Rental Intent Detection
1. Ask Copilot: "How can we extend the intent detection in utility.py to include car rental agent?"
2. Walk through Copilot's suggestion to modify the existing code
3. Implement the changes and test them

## 8. Real-World Scenario: Adding a New Agent Feature (15 minutes)

### Feature: Multi-step Problem Solving

#### Task: Add Car Availability Check Tool
1. Tell Copilot: "We need to add a tool for checking car availability on specific dates"
2. Have Copilot create:
   - A new function in car_rental_plugins.py
   - Update the RTMiddleTier class to support the new tool
   - Add appropriate error handling
3. Showcase how Copilot handles the complete workflow

### Bonus: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration Example
1. Ask about using the Model Context Protocol: "How can I use MCP to improve the car rental agent's responses?"
2. Show how Copilot provides guidance on implementing this advanced feature

## 9. Troubleshooting With Copilot (10 minutes)

### Feature: Agent Mode

1. Type "/agent" to start an agent session
2. Present a complex problem: "I'm getting an error when trying to transfer a conversation between agents. Here's the error log..."
3. Demonstrate how the Copilot agent walks through diagnosing and solving the issue

## 10. CLI Integration (5 minutes)

### Feature: Command Line Interface Support

1. Open the integrated terminal in VSCode
2. Type a partial command (e.g., "az openai")
3. Show how Copilot suggests command completions for CLI commands
4. Demonstrate how Copilot can help with complex terminal commands for deployment or testing

## 11. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)

### Key Takeaways:
- Copilot enhances developer productivity through various interaction modes
- It can help with tasks from simple code completion to complex problem-solving
- Most effective when using the right command for the right situation

### Final Tips:
- Use natural language to describe what you want
- Be specific with your requests
- Leverage both inline suggestions and chat interface
- Use commands (#, @, /) for specialized tasks
- Always review AI-generated code for correctness and security
